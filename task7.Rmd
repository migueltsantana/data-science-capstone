## Motivation

Natural language processing (NLP) has become an integral part of many industries, from customer service to healthcare. 

Developing a prediction algorithm for NLP can significantly improve accuracy and efficiency, allowing for faster and more accurate data analysis.

**Join us in building the future of NLP with this exciting project!**

## N-gram prediction function

```{r echo=TRUE}
ngrams <- function(input){
  # Create a dataframe
  input <- data_frame(text = input)
  # Clean the Inpput
  replace_reg <- "[^[:alpha:][:space:]]*"
  input <- input %>%
    mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, replace_reg, ""))
  # Find word count, separate words, lower case
  input_count <- str_count(input, boundary("word"))
  input_words <- unlist(str_split(input, boundary("word")))
  input_words <- tolower(input_words)
  # Call the matching functions
  out <- ifelse(input_count == 1, bigram(input_words), 
              ifelse (input_count == 2, trigram(input_words), 
                      quadgram(input_words)))
  # Output
  return(out)
}
```

## Shiny App - How it works?

The app was built using Shiny. To use the app, you will have to insert the work or phrase and it will automatically generate the next predicted word, without submitting.

The app then checks the word against the prediction algorithm. This prediction is based from longest to shortest N-gram frequency.
